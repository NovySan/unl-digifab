# "Even machines as simple as thermostats can be said to have beliefs.”

John McCarthy, in "Ascribing Mental Qualities to Machined" 1969.

In his 1969 essay arguing in favor of Strong Artificial Intelligence, ascribing human qualities of belief, desire, and intention to simple sensors and electronics.

# Process

Using the __Servo->Sweep__ example, and experimenting with `Servo.write()` and `delay()`s, create some kind of simple "animilistic" motion with your arduino. You should use one or both of your micro servos. You will need to attach some limbs, arms, other elements to your servo. Think about building a body and some appendages. This is a good chance to use the laser cutter. We are thinking quick and dirty, low-fidelity prototype. Focus on motion, and the ways that motion can be expressive, communicate. For an example, see Ian Ingram's work ([website](https://ianingram.org/machines.html)). 

# Submission
1. Canvas:
   - Arduino code as .zip file. 
   - Photo of your circuit.
   - Video documenting your biomimicry in action.
   - (use the naming convention _ex8_Lastname_1.zip_, _ex8_Lastname.jpg_ and _ex8_Lastname.mp4 for the files.)

2. Sketchbook Updates:
   - add images of the scans, Rhino file, and STL file to your sketchbook.

DUE: 11/11/2021, 9PM. See [Canvas](https://canvas.unl.edu/courses/114938/assignments/1112905).
