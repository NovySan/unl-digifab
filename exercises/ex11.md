# Process
1. Start with the Arduino blink example (**Examples->01.Basics->Blink**), you will convert this simple ON/OFF pattern into a meaningful signal. 


# Submission
1. Canvas:
   - Arduino code as .zip file. 
   - Photo of your circuit.
   - Video documenting your "signal" in action.
   - (use the naming convention _ex8_Lastname_1.zip_, _ex8_Lastname.jpg_ and _ex8_Lastname.mp4 for the files.)

2. Sketchbook Updates:
   - add images of the scans, Rhino file, and STL file to your sketchbook.
