# Flat Pack Future

This exercise is about building 3d form using 2D materials. I want you to design a kit of parts that can be assembled to create a 3D form. On the laser cutter we can cut flat stock (corrugated cardboard, matte board, architectural pywood) and use it to assemble 3d forms.

# Process
1. Ideation
   - What kind of a form do you want to make? (Discuss)
2. Design
   - Refer to our week3 tutorials [../sessions/week3.md] and the video recording.
3. Fabrication
   - What time will we have open fabrication hours? (Tuesday, Wednesday)

# Submission
1. Documentation:
   - Take screenshots of your 2d designs
   - Photos/videos to document your fabrication and assembly process
   - Photographs of your final product, assembled. Follow good documentation procedure.
   - SVG export of your final design, formatted to run on our laser cutter. (remember to hide extraneous layers)
   - Photographs of your final product.
2. Sketchbook: update your sketchbook for this exercise
   - Sketches
   - Screenshots of 2D designs
   - Process images/videos
   - Photos of final product
   - Any notes, narrative about process.
3. Submission: 
   - upload your files to Canvas (use the naming convention _ex1_Lastname_1.jpg_ and _ex1_Lastname.stl_ for the files.)
   - Photographs of final product
   - SVG file of output
   - Rhino file (3DM)
