# Digital Double / Virtual Replica

For this exercise, you will create a digital double of an object. You will do this in a two step process: first we will make a series of measurements and reference drawings to record all of the essential dimensions of the object. Secondly we will use those drawings as a reference while we make a 3D model in Rhino. Give some consideration to what object you would like to replicate. We will use this in Week 4/5 with the 3d printer, so choose something smallish (the size of an orange), or something that would be interesting to print at that scale.

There are many other ways to get an object into Rhino / into the computer (for instance 3D scanning, photogrammetry), we are using drawing and 3D modeling as a means to get experience with Rihno for 3D fabrication.

# Process
1. Choose an object to replicate. Choose something from your immediate surroundings that you have access too.
   - Some considerations: 
     - Choose something smallish (the size of an orange), or something that would be interesting to print at that scale.
     - Choose something with a regular geometric structure, or something that you can build from a combination of geometric elements. Our drawing tools are best at drawing geometry (Boxes, Spheres, etc.)
     - Thank about something you would like to have as a tiny digital replica. (thoughts?) 
     - Imagine staging a photograph of your digital replica (3d printed) next to the real object. What would make for a most interesting pairing?
3. (pen and paper): Make a number of hand-drawn technical drawings to record the dimensions of the object
  - Use the calipers to get precise measurements. 
  - Draw a number of views of the object (Side, Top, Front, Perspective) and label dimensions on those drawings. 
    - For instance, if modeling a water bottle, you might label the total height of the bottle, and the thickness of the cap in a Side view.
  - Use __Detail__ views where necessary to notate dimensions of small... _details_.
4. Model your object in Rhino
  - Use the commands we practiced in class together.
5. Export your model as an STL file.

# Submission
1. Prepare your materials:
   - Take photographs of your object
   - Take photographs of your sketches
   - Export your solid as an STL file.
2. Update your sketchbook with photos, sketches, and snapshot of your STL file.
3. Upload your files to Canvas: (use the naming convention _ex1_Lastname_1.jpg_ and _ex1_Lastname.stl_ for the files.)
  1. photograph of object
  2. STL of model

DUE 9/9, 9pm (Thursday) to Canvas https://canvas.unl.edu/courses/114938/assignments/1079274
