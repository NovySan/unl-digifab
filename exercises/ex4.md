# Real World and Back Again

Using polycam, you are going to digitize a real object. 

# Process
1. Ideation
   - What kind of a form do you want to make? (Discuss)
2. Design
   - Refer to our [week3 tutorials](../sessions/week3.md) and the video recording.
   - You will create a complete 2D layout for your part in Rhino. 
   - You do not necessarily need to assemble it in 3D in Rhino. (Though if it helps you to think through how the piece will go together, then extrude your outlines as 2D parts, and rotate/translate/assemble them in 3D)
3. Fabrication
   - You need to actually fabricate this assignment from some flat material. 
     -  I suggest that you use salvaged corrogated cardboard.
   - What time will we have open fabrication hours? check [here](https://github.com/roberttwomey/unl-digifab/blob/master/sessions/week3.md#office-hours)

# Submission
1. Documentation:
   - Take screenshots of your 2d designs
   - Photos/videos to document your fabrication and assembly process
   - Photographs of your final product, assembled. Follow good documentation procedure.
   - SVG export of your final design, formatted to run on our laser cutter. (remember to hide extraneous layers)
   - Photographs of your final product.
2. Sketchbook Updates:
   - sketches; screenshots of 2D designs; process images/videos; photos of final product; any notes, narrative about process.
3. Submission: 
   - Photographs of the final product
   - 
   - Rhino file (3DM)
   - Upload all of these files to Canvas
     - (use the naming convention _ex3_Lastname_1.jpg_ and _ex3_Lastname.svg_ _ex3_Lastname.3dm_ for the files.)

DUE 9/16, 9pm (Thursday) to [Canvas](https://canvas.unl.edu/courses/114938/assignments/1086825)
