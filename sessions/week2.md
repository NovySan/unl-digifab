# Rhino 2D Basics
1. Create new file from template. Small objects inches.
2. User interface:
   - Switch between single and quad (four-up) display. 
   - Pan, tilt, zoom in display. 
   - Turning __Grid Snap__ on and off. (To create points that stick to origin, 0.25in, etc.) Try as a text command: Type _Snap_ once to turn it on. Once to turn it off.
3. 2D Primitives
   - [_Line_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/line.htm). 
     - Choose start of line, end of line. 
     - Hold __shift__ key while drawing to make the line orthogonal (Right Angle). [_Ortho_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/ortho.htm)
   - [_Rectangle_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/rectangle.htm)
   - [_Circle_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/circle.htm)
   - [_Polygon_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/polygon.htm)
4. 2D Operations
  - [_Trim_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/trim.htm) uses one object to cut and delete parts of another object.
  - [_Split_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/split.htm) uses one object to cut and split another object.
  - [_Join_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/join.htm) connects objects to form a single object
  - [_Extend_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/extend.htm)lengthens or shortens a curve
5. Organization
  - [Layers](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/layer.htm). [Using layers](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#seealso/sak_layer.htm).
  - [_Group_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/group.htm)
  - [_Ungroup_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/ungroup.htm)
  - How to Select things. 
6. Transforms
  - _Scale_
  - _Rotate_
  - _Move_
  - _PointsOn_, _PointsOff_. ([NURBS](https://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/nurbs))

# Measuring Objects
- Recording dimensions (pen and paper)
- Taking dimensions
  - Digital Calipers
  - Tape measure
  - 3D Scanner
- Transferrig dimensions to a Rhino model
