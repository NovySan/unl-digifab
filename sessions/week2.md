# Rhino 2D Basics
1. Create new file from template. Small objects inches.
2. User interface:
   - Switch between single and quad (four-up) display. 
   - Pan, tilt, zoom in display. 
   - Turning __Grid Snap__ on and off. (To create points that stick to origin, 0.25in, etc.) Try as a text command: Type _Snap_ once to turn it on. Once to turn it off.
3. 2D Primitives
   - [_Line_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/line.htm). 
     - Choose start of line, end of line. 
     - Hold __shift__ key while drawing to make the line orthogonal (Right Angle). [_Ortho_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/ortho.htm)
   - [_Rectangle_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/rectangle.htm)
   - [_Circle_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/circle.htm)
   - [_Polygon_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/polygon.htm)
4. 2D Operations
   - [_Trim_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/trim.htm) uses one object to cut and delete parts of another object.
   - [_Split_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/split.htm) uses one object to cut and split another object.
   - [_Join_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/join.htm) connects objects to form a single object
   - [_Extend_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/extend.htm)lengthens or shortens a curve
5. Organization
   - [Layers](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/layer.htm). [Using layers](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#seealso/sak_layer.htm).
   - [_Group_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/group.htm)
   - [_Ungroup_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/ungroup.htm)
   - [Selecting](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#popup_actions/select_objects.htm). How to Select things with the mouse.
   - Selection Menu
6. Transforms
   - [_Scale_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/scale.htm)
   - [_Rotate_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/rotate.htm)
   - [_Move_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/move.htm)
7. Direct Manipulation
   - Changing objects once you have drawn them. We are dealing with [NURBS](https://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/nurbs)
   - [_PointsOn_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/pointson.htm)
     - Click and drag to move points. Use transforms (_Move_). 
   - [_PointsOff_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/pointsoff.htm)

# Measuring Objects
- Recording dimensions (pen and paper)
- Taking dimensions
  - Digital Calipers
  - Tape measure
  - 3D Scanner
- Transferring dimensions to a Rhino model
