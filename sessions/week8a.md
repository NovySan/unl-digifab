[Dark Matter (First Series)](http://www.morehshin.com/dark-matter-first-series/) by Moreshin Allahyari.


### Description
Following Moreshin's Dark Matter (and Urs Fischer's sculpture above) for this assignment I want you to find two objects, boolean them together (either subtraction, intersection, joining, etc.) and add a base. You should then slice this so we know it is 3d printable. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PRINT THIS but I do want it sliced. 

1. Find two 3d models to work with. You can find them online, or model your own.
2. Import your 3d models into Rhino.
3. Create an extruded base.
4. Slice this model for the Ultimaker,Prusa MK3S+,Formlabs, or Stratasys. 
5. Screen capture your sliced model

### Submission
- Add documentation of this (screenshots of rhino, screenshot of the slicer) to your digital sketchbook. 
- Submit to [Canvas](https://canvas.unl.edu/courses/137404/assignments/1350190). DUE: Monday 10/9 11:59pm.
  - a pdf of these pages from the digital sketchbook
  - your rhino file (.3dm)
