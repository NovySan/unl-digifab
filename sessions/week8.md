# Week 7 - Prusa; 3D Printing in Lab; Project 1 Discussion

## Agenda
- Artist of the Day:
  - Marguerite Humeau - [The Rebirth of Prehistoric Creatures](https://we-make-money-not-art.com/back_here_below_formidable/)
  - Liberator ([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DconsfGsXyA))
- Prusa Orientation and Start 3D Prints
- Project 1
- [Physical Computing Kits](#physical-computing-kits)
- [Office Hours this Week](#office-hours)

## Prusa Orientation
- Which part do you want to print (virtual replica, 3d scan)
- Project prep:
  - Consider how long it will print (can you get it down to 1:30 to test?)
  - Export as GCODE. 
  - Save to SD card.
  - BUY YOUR OWN SD CARD. These will disappear.
- Stay with the print for the first 10-15 minutes, or until the first layer is complete.

## Physical Computing Kits

For Week 8 (NEXT WEEK) each of you needs to purchase an electronics kit from the ECE shop. This costs $18.65. Please let me know if the costs presents a challenge for you.

You can buy at the store with the N-CARD. Or you can pay for them online [EMAR 391 Class Kit](https://marketplace.unl.edu/ees/engineering-class-kits/emar391.html).

There is a lot of construction over there. Once you enter the building through the main entrance on 16th street (technically [Othmer Hall](https://maps.unl.edu/OTHM), I think), turn left and walk down the hallway into Scott Engineering Center. The shop is on the ground floor and very challenging to find.
