## Extruding Curves
- We can **extrude** a 2d curve into 3 dimensions to see what it would look like as a flat object. 
  - [_ExtrudeCrv_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/7/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/extrudecrv.htm) **<--- THIS IS OUR GOTO**
- Load up your tab and slot construction from last week (or make a new one).
- If you have not already, join the perimeters for each of the pieces so that you have continuous outlines. 
- Extrude the curves into three dimensions using Extrude Curve.
- Use the transformations and object snaps to assemble your pieces together into a virtual model: 
  - [_Move_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/7/help/en-us/commands/move.htm)
  - [_Rotate_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/7/help/en-us/commands/rotate.htm)
  - [_object snaps_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/7/help/en-us/user_interface/object_snaps.htm)
- Take a screenshot ([_ViewCapture_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/7/help/en-us/commands/viewcapture.htm#ViewCaptureToFile)) and save to file. 
  - Rotate the viewport to capture a number of different vantage points.
  - Experiment with the [_Display Options_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/7/help/en-us/options/view_displaymode_options.htm) to choose an aesthetically pleasing render.

Rhino file: [stacked_contours_offset.3dm](../examples/stacked_contours_offset.3dm)

Workflow: 
- draw some curves using the 2d drawing tools (Curve, Line, Trim/Join, etc.)
- [_Offset_](http://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/7/help/en-us/commands/offset.htm)
- [_ExtrudeCrv_](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/7/help/en-us/index.htm#commands/extrudecrv.htm)
- Move the curves into position, stacking them vertically.


## Stacking Contours
## Homework
**Stacked Contours**

- Draw a series of contours (curves, linesâ€“line art) which you will then stack into 3 dimensions. 
- Assemble these in 3d. 
- Document your resultant assemblage with a number of screenshots (3 minimum). 
- Upload your Rhino File and screen shots to Canvas: [https://canvas.unl.edu/courses/158902/assignments/1521871](https://canvas.unl.edu/courses/158902/assignments/1521871).
