### 3d Scanning
- Two main techniques: photogrammetry and LIDAR
  - Photogrammetry
  - LIDAR / 3d scanning (with laser)
    - ArTec scanner at NIS.
- Examples of room scans (Twomey)
- Simple solution, phone/tablet apps.
  - Scaniverse [https://scaniverse.com/](https://scaniverse.com/) 
  - Polycam [https://poly.cam](https://poly.cam/) - does both photogrammetry and LIDAR
  - Scandy Pro [https://www.scandy.co/apps/scandy-pro](https://www.scandy.co/apps/scandy-pro) - can use the front facing lidar camera (FaceID) on iphone/tablet to do detailed scan. 
  - Other approaches?
- Strengths and limitations of various approaches. 
- Hands-on.
