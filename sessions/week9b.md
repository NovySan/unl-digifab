### 3d Scanning
- Two main techniques: photogrammetry and LIDAR
  - Photogrammetry
  - LIDAR / 3d scanning (with laser)
    - ArTec scanner at NIS.
- Examples of room scans (Twomey)
- Simple solution, phone/tablet apps.
  - Scaniverse [https://scaniverse.com/](https://scaniverse.com/) 
  - Polycam [https://poly.cam](https://poly.cam/) - does both photogrammetry and LIDAR
  - Scandy Pro [https://www.scandy.co/apps/scandy-pro](https://www.scandy.co/apps/scandy-pro) - can use the front facing lidar camera (FaceID) on iphone/tablet to do detailed scan. 
  - Other approaches?
- Strengths and limitations of various approaches. 
- Hands-on.

### 3D Scans in Rhino
- Really just working with Meshes. 


### Homework

**Scan Big Print Small**

Using the ipad pro with Polycam or your own device, digitize a real world object. Think big: the rear camera LIDAR is best body to room scale. Photogrammetry is ok for a range of sizes. Here we will play with scale:

1. Scan something big
2. Share the mesh with yourself (AirDrop, email, or some other means to get it off of the iPad)
3. Clean up the mesh in Rhino. 
4. Print it at (small) scale (< 3x3x3")

**Submission**

1. Document the scan with screenshots in Rhino.
2. Document the printed object with photographs. 
3. Add these materials to your digital sketchbook and upload the new pages as a pdf.
