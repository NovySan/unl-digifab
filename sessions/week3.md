# Intro to Laser Cutter

Hands-on with our [FSL Muse 3D (Full Spectrum Laser)](https://fslaser.com/fsl-muse-3d-autofocus-desktop-co2-laser-cutter-bundle/):

1. Laser basics
   - Safety (air filtration; fire safety)
   - __ALWAYS__ before you cut: turn on the Water Cooler, Exhaust, Air Assist.
2. Material choice (good and bad materials for lasers)
   - _Good_ materials to start with:
     - thick papers (card stock, manilla folder, index cards, office paper, watercolor paper, bristol board, vellum)
     - thin cardboard (poster board, matte board, corrugated cardboard - i.e. cardboard boxes)
     - plastic sheets (acrylic, ABS)
     - wood (architectural plywood, balsa wood, thin birch plywood, veneers) 
     - engraving on leather
     - textiles
   - _Bad_ materials:
     - anything vinyl (PVC plastic tube and sheet, vinyl decals)
     - polystyrene (i.e. styrofoam, packing peanuts)
   - What other materials do you have questions about?
3. Laser Settings
   - For any given material, we need to find the right cutting settings. 
   - There are three parameters we set: __Speed__, __Power__, __Current__.
     - (see the chart at the bottom fo the page for some starting points for different materials)
   - We can do formal tests to find the best parameters. See this [Materials Test](http://laser101.fslaser.com/materialtest) procedure.
     - (we can also do this a little more informally) 
     - Blog post on [Laser Settings for Cutting](http://blog.fslaser.com/experts/muse-workflow-laser-settings-for-cutting)
   - Over time, we (as a Center) will come up with our own materials settings that work well with our laser cutter. 
   - So, __log your cuts__: (date, time, material, thickness, power settings)
     - (we need this to build our library of materials and settings)
4. Cut Types
   - Engraving vs Cutting: 
     - __Engraving__: marking patterns into the surface of a material (faster, lower power, can engrave materials like glass, stone that can't be cut through)
     - __Cutting__: cutting through the material. (slow, higher power, smokes/catches fire) 
   - __Vector Cutting__: cutting shapes out of materials. **this is the bulk of what we will do** SVG files. 
   - __Vector Engraving__: using vector art to mark the surface. designs, patterns, cross-hatching. SVGs.
   - __Raster Engraving__: rendering a bitmap on the surface of something, row by row like an old school printer. BMPs.

5. Cut demos
   - We will use your HW1. 

# Cutting
Full Spectrum Laser has their own engraving software called [RetinaEngrave](https://fslaser.com/re3/).  We will use it from the workstation on the laser table.

1. Create Design
2. Open RetinaEngrave on the workstation. (Desktop Shortcut, or Safari -> `fslca88.local`)
3. Import the design (SVG file). We will use HW1.
4. Place your material in the laser cutter
5. Secure your material (blue tape)
6. Capture workspace (camera)
7. Change your line colors/layer colors, if you need to.
8. Change your scale/placement, if necessary. 
9. Set the engraving properties - __Vector Engraving__ (note, it is all called "engraving" in Muse)
10. Turn on Water Cooler; Exhaust; Air Assist.
11. Run job.



# Design for Laser Cutter
1. Create new file from template. Small objects inches.
2. Drawing in 2d; using layers
4. Exporting to SVG.
5. Let's fix our HW1 and then cut some.
