  - [Prepping for 3DP](#prepping-for-3dp)
  - [Slicing for 3DP](#slicing-for-3dp)
- Intro to the 3d Printer

### Importing Models

- Create a new file in Rhino and import a 3d scan 
  - [bunny.ply](../assets/day5/bunny.ply) (3MB)
- Find the bunny and scale to an appropriate size. 
  - Locate (Zoom eXtents), Rotate, Scale
  - Simplify Mesh (MeshReduce) if necessary

### Prepping for 3DP
- Add a base
- Add a label (text objects as solids)
- Is it a closed object? 
  - Mesh -> Repair Tools
- Save as STL.

### Slicing for 3DP
- [Download Prusa Slicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/) (DRIVERS & APPS)
- Load your STL file from the previous steps. 
- Check scale, positioning. 
- Select print parameters.
  - Material. Slicing. Support. 
- Add multiple objects to a build.
