## Digitizing Objects
- Two main technologies: photogrammetry and LIDAR

## 3D Scans into Rhino

__Importing a 3D Scan__
- Create a new file in Rhino and import a 3d scan 
  - [bunny.ply](../assets/day5/bunny.ply) (3MB)
- Find the bunny and scale to an appropriate size. 
  - Locate (Zoom eXtents), Rotate, Scale
  - Simplify Mesh (MeshReduce) if necessary

__Prepping for 3DP__
- Add a base
- Add a label (text objects as solids)
- Save as STL.

## Slicing for 3DP
- [Download Prusa Slicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/) (DRIVERS & APPS)
- Load your STL file from above. 
- Check scale, positioning. 
- Select print parameters.

## Meshmixer
- [Download Meshmixer](https://www.meshmixer.com/download.html)

## Homework
- Exercise 5 DUE Thursday September 30, 9pm
- Concept for Project 1. 2 paragraphs on Canvas.

## Office Hours 
- Wednesday afternoon 9/29 (after 1pm)
