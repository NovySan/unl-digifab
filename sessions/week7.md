## Monday

- Working with the Prusa Printer
- Intro to the 3d Printer
  - Loading and Unloading Filament.  
  - Setting the Build Height (First Layer Calibration)
  - Printing from a file. 
  - Stay your print for the 10-15 minutes, or until the first few layers have completed, to be sure it is printing correctly. If the build height seems off, quit the print and re-rerun the first layer calibration.

[Dark Matter (First Series)](http://www.morehshin.com/dark-matter-first-series/) by Moreshin Allahyari.


### Description
Following Moreshin's Dark Matter (and Urs Fischer's sculpture above) for this assignment I want you to find two objects, boolean them together (either subtraction, intersection, joining, etc.) and add a base. You should then slice this so we know it is 3d printable. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PRINT THIS but I do want it sliced. 

1. Find two 3d models to work with. You can find them online, or model your own.
2. Import your 3d models into Rhino.
3. Create an extruded base.
4. Slice this model for the Prusa MK3S+, PLA filament. 
5. Screen capture your sliced model

### Submission
- Add documentation of this (screenshots of rhino, screenshot of the slicer) to your digital sketchbook. 
- Submit to [Canvas](https://canvas.unl.edu/courses/137404/assignments/1350190). DUE: Monday 10/4 11:59pm.
  - a pdf of these pages from the digital sketchbook
  - your rhino file (.3dm)
