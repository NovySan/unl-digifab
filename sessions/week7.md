# Week 7 - 3D Printing in Lab; Prusa; Project 1 Discussion

## Agenda
- Artist of the Day
- Discussion:
  - Configure Rhinoceros Zoo (carson center license for Rhino 6.0)
    - (Update: is working on wired connection, still not working on eduroam for me)
- Prusa Orientation and Start 3D Prints
- Project 1
- Physical Computing Kits
- [Office Hours this Week](#office-hours)

## Digitizing Objects
- Two main techniques: photogrammetry and LIDAR
  - Photogrammetry
  - LIDAR / 3d scanning (with laser)
    - ArTec scanner at NIS.

## 3D Scans into Rhino

__Importing a 3D Scan__
- Create a new file in Rhino and import a 3d scan 
  - [bunny.ply](../assets/day5/bunny.ply) (3MB)
- Find the bunny and scale to an appropriate size. 
  - Locate (Zoom eXtents), Rotate, Scale
  - Simplify Mesh (MeshReduce) if necessary

__Prepping for 3DP__
- Add a base
- Add a label (text objects as solids)
- Is it a closed object? 
  - Mesh -> Repair Tools
- Save as STL.

## Slicing for 3DP
- [Download Prusa Slicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/) (DRIVERS & APPS)
- Load your STL file from the previous steps. 
- Check scale, positioning. 
- Select print parameters.
  - Material. Slicing. Support. 
- Add multiple objects to a build.

## Meshmixer
- [Download Meshmixer](https://www.meshmixer.com/download.html)
- Hacking things together with meshmixer.
- Exporting for 3DP (.STL)

## Homework
- [Exercise 5](../exercises/ex5.md) DUE Thursday September 30, 9pm
- Concept for Project 1. 2 paragraphs on Canvas.

## Office Hours 
- Wednesday afternoon 9/29 (after 1pm)
