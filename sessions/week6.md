# Week 6 - 3D Printing

| [Tuesday](#tuesday) | [Thursday](#thursday) |

## Tuesday

- Working with the Prusa Printer
- Intro to the 3d Printer
  - Loading and Unloading Filament.  
  - Setting the Build Height (First Layer Calibration)
  - Printing from a file. 
  - Stay your print for the 10-15 minutes, or until the first few layers have completed, to be sure it is printing correctly. If the build height seems off, quit the print and re-rerun the first layer calibration.

- Homework: Complete your Trophy project from last week, DUE Friday at midnight.

## Homework-2

**Venus of Willendorf** (25000bce) [stl file](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-venus-of-willendorf-at-the-naturhistorisches-museum-vienna-austria-11455) from Scan the World on myminifactory

### Description
You are going to combine a 3d scanned object with a base and text to make a small trophy (< 3" x 3" x 3"). Try to come up with some interesting combination between text, object, and base.

1. Find a 3d model you want to work with. See references below. It does not have to be a historical artifact.
2. Import your scanned object into Rhino.
3. Create an extruded base
4. Add Text. 
5. Slice this model for the Prusa MK3S+, PLA filament.
6. Finally you will 3d print this model. 

### Submission
- Add documentation of this (screenshots of rhino, screenshot of the slicer) to your digital sketchbook. 
- Submit a pdf of these pages from the digital sketchbook to [Canvas](https://canvas.unl.edu/courses/137404/assignments/1350190). DUE: Tuesday 10/4, 11:59pm.
