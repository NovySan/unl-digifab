# Project 3: Mechatronics
## Description

The final project needs to integrate digital fabrication with physical computing (inputs, outputs, sensors, actuators). 

The project assignment is open. Think of the ways in which a project might have behavior. 

For this project you will use the 3d design and fabrication techniques that we have covered in class so far, as appropriate to your concept:
- 3d modeling (Rhino, as well any other software you have experience with)
- 3d scanning
- laser cutting
- 3d printing

You will also meed to use your Arduino and some combination of sensors (photoresistor, rangefinder, potentiometer, etc.) and actuators (lights, buzzer, servo, etc.)

Your project needs to have some meaningful behavior, whether preprogrammed, or in response to sensor/user input or interaction. 

We will critique these projects the last week of class, Week 16.

## Proposal

You will submit a two paragraph proposal for your idea addressing the following questions below. The first paragraph should describe how you are choosing to approach the project and get us excited for the concept. The second paragraph will address the logistics of your project and how you will produce and document the result.

- Concept (1 paragraph)
  - Describe your idea. 
  - What behavior will your project demonstrate?
  - Describe any interactivity, or what role the audience will play in activating your piece.
  - How will you present your object?

- Process (1 paragraph)
  - What sensors will you use?
  - What actuators will you use? 
  - What elements will be fabricated?
  - How will you document your project? Consider where you will photograph the resulting object? What supporting images wil Where will you document your object?

This written description will be [submitted online to Canvas](https://canvas.unl.edu/courses/137404/assignments/1370188) by Tuesday November 22.

## Deliverables

1. Submission:  
   - upload the following to Canvas.
   - Written Project Description (update your written proposal once you are done with the project, this is your project description)
   - Rhino Models (.3dm)
   - Printable file (.stl) 
   - Documentation (photographs)
2. Critique: 
   - Present both your Object and your documentation for Critique.
