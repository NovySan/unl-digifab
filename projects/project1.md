# Project 1: Hybrid Object
## Description

For this project you will make an object that is a combination of two (or more) things at once. This could be a literal hybrid of multiple objects (see Moreshin Allahyari's Dark Metter), an online / offline object (existing both in digital form and physical form), or some individual direction you identify that hybridizes between two forms. See the [references](#references) below for some examples. The concept is open-ended, but you will need to submit a written proposal for your project. (see [proposal](#proposal) below)

For this project you will use the 3d design and fabrication techniques that we have covered in class so far, as appropriate to your concept:
- 3d modeling (Rhino, as well any other software you have experience with)
- 3d scanning (with ipad/iphone or ArTec scanner at NIS)
- laser cutting
- 3d printing

We will critique these projects in three weeks, Week 10.

## Proposal

You will submit a two paragraph proposal for your idea addressing the following questions below. The first paragraph should describe how you are choosing to approach the hybrid object prompt and get us excited for the concept. The second paragraph will address the logistics of your project and how you will produce and document the result.

- What is your object a hybrid between?
- (use 3d scanning and 3d modeling)
- Paragraph 2 - Logistics
  - Do you use a re
  - Which fabrication techniques will you use, and how? 
  - What materials will you fabricate your object from?
  - What surface treatments will you use? 
  - Where will you document your object?

This will be [submitted online to Canvas](https://canvas.unl.edu/courses/114938/discussion_topics/805312) by Thursday October 7.

## Deliverables

1. Written Proposal to Canvas (10/7)
2. Materials to Canvas
   - 3D Models (.3dm) 
   - Documentation
3. Documentation and Object for Critique
