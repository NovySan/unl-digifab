# Project 1: Hybrid Object
## Description

For this project you will make an object that is a combination of two (or more) things at once. This could be a literal hybrid of multiple objects (see Moreshin Allahyari's Dark Metter), an online / offline object (existing both in digital form and physical form), or some individual direction you identify that hybridizes between two forms. See the [references](#references) below for some examples. The concept is open-ended, but you will need to submit a written proposal for your project. (see [proposal](#proposal) below)

For this project you will use the 3d design and fabrication techniques that we have covered in class so far, as appropriate to your concept:
- 3d modeling (Rhino, as well any other software you have experience with)
- 3d scanning (with ipad/iphone or ArTec scanner at NIS)
- laser cutting
- 3d printing

We will critique these projects in three weeks, Week 10.

## Proposal

You will submit a two paragraph proposal for your idea addressing the following questions below. The first paragraph should describe how you are choosing to approach the hybrid object prompt and get us excited for the concept. The second paragraph will address the logistics of your project and how you will produce and document the result.

- Concept (1 paragraph)
  - Describe your approach to the prompt. What is your object a hybrid between? 
  - Are you using real objects? Fictional objects? 
  - Is narrative an important element of your piece?
  - How will you present your object / document it?

- Process (1 paragraph)
  - How will you produce your 3d modelsâ€”capturing real objects (3d scanning), 3d modeling, other approaches? Describe how these approaches serve your concept.
  - Which fabrication techniques from class will you use?
  - What materials will you fabricate your object from? What (if any) surface treatments will you use? What non-digital material/craft processes will you use?
  - How will you document your project? Consider where you will photograph the resulting object? What supporting images wil Where will you document your object?

This written description will be [submitted online to Canvas](https://canvas.unl.edu/courses/114938/discussion_topics/805312) by Thursday October 7.

## Deliverables

1. Proposal: 
   - written proposal to Canvas (10/7)
2. Submission:  
   - upload the following to Canvas (10/28)
   - Written Project Description (update your written proposal once you are done with the project, this is your project description)
   - Rhino Models (.3dm)
   - Printable file (.stl) 
   - Documentation (photographs)
3. Critique: 
   - Present both your Object and your documentation for Critique. (10/28)

  - A [hyperreal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality) object or [simulacrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacrum). Replace an everyday object with its digital double
  - A real object, and a fabricated prosthetic for the object
