# Project 1: Hybrid Object
## Description

For this project you will make an object that is a combination of two (or more) things at once. It could be an online / offline object (existing both in digital form and physical form), a mix of actual objects (see Moreshin Allahyari's Dark Matter), or some individual direction you identify that hybridizes between two things. 

For this project you will use the 3d design and fabrication techniques that we have covered in class so far, as appropriate to your concept:
- 3d modeling (Rhino, as well any other software you have experience with)
- 3d scanning (with ipad/iphone or ArTec scanner at NIS)
- laser cutting
- 3d printing

You will present both the actual object and documentation.
