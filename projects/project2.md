# Project 2: Physical Computing
## Description

The final project needs to integrate digital fabrication with physical computing (inputs, outputs, sensors, actuators). 

The project assignment is open. If you are looking for inspiration, consider [Exercise 12 - Even Thermostats](../exercises/ex12.md). Think of the ways in which a project might have behavior. 

For this project you will use the 3d design and fabrication techniques that we have covered in class so far, as appropriate to your concept:
- 3d modeling (Rhino, as well any other software you have experience with)
- laser cutting
- 3d printing

You will also meed to use your Arduino and some combination of sensors (photoresistor, rangefinder, etc.) and actuators (lights, buzzer, servo, etc.)

We will critique these projects the last week of class, Week 16.

<!-- ## Proposal

You will submit a two paragraph proposal for your idea addressing the following questions below. The first paragraph should describe how you are choosing to approach the hybrid object prompt and get us excited for the concept. The second paragraph will address the logistics of your project and how you will produce and document the result.

- Concept (1 paragraph)
  - Describe your approach.
  - Are you using real objects? Fictional objects? 
  - Is narrative an important element of your piece?
  - How will you present your object / document it?

- Process (1 paragraph)
  - How will you produce your 3d modelsâ€”capturing real objects (3d scanning), 3d modeling, other approaches? Describe how these approaches serve your concept.
  - Which fabrication techniques from class will you use?
  - What materials will you fabricate your object from? What (if any) surface treatments will you use? What non-digital material/craft processes will you use?
  - How will you document your project? Consider where you will photograph the resulting object? What supporting images wil Where will you document your object?

This written description will be [submitted online to Canvas](https://canvas.unl.edu/courses/114938/discussion_topics/805312) by Thursday October 7.

## Deliverables

1. Submission:  
   - upload the following to Canvas.
   - Written Project Description (update your written proposal once you are done with the project, this is your project description)
   - Rhino Models (.3dm)
   - Printable file (.stl) 
   - Documentation (photographs)
2. Critique: 
   - Present both your Object and your documentation for Critique.
